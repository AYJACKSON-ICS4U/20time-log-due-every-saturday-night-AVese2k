### Week 1 Log
This week I have annouced my 20time project to the class. I plan to write a series of question on brilliant.org with respect to Rational Trigonometry (Norman Wildberger) to allow this theory be considered by other people, respond to questions, receive feedback, comment on solutions I receive, and write solutions and problems myself. I already have a few questions written already.
