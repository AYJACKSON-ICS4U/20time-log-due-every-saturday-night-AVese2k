This week I have decided to make a website for the 20 time project. I am still in the process of figuring out what the website will be about, so I have not started coding anything yet. Before I start coding, I will have to learn the languages that are neccessary to make a website. This week, I plan on deciding the purpose of the website and continuing to learn the languages needed to make it.
