This week I have decided to make a website for the 20 time project. I am still in the process of figuring out what the website will be about, so I have not started coding anything yet. Before I start coding, I will have to learn the languages that are neccessary to make a website. This week, I plan on deciding the purpose of the website and continuing to learn the languages needed to make it.

This week I have continued to learn the languages that I will use to make my website. Specifically, I have finished learning the essentials of JavaScript and have moved on to the basics of HTML and CSS. In the next week, I will advance to more of the details of the two languages. I planned on deciding the purpose of my website this week, but I am still in the process of making that decision.

This week I started learning the details of HTML and CSS. I spent all my time in class progressing in these two languages, so I did not choose a topic for my website. Next week, I would like to finish the HTML/CSS lessons on Khan Academy and depending on how much time that leaves I could choose the purpose of my website.

In the past week, I continued learning the details of HTML and CSS, but did not finish the lessons on Khan Academy. By the end of this week I would like to finish these lessons and move on to something else. The process of choosing the purpose of my website is still ongoing.

In the past week, I completed the HTML/CSS lessons on khan academy so I now have the ability to make a very simple website. Eventually I would like to learn more about these languages so I can make a higher quality, more complex website. Now that I am done the khan academy lessons, I will try to focus more on deciding a purpose for my website. Once this is done, I will be able to move on to planning how the website will look.

This week I did not spend any time working on my 20 time project. In the next few weeks I would like to have chosen a purpose for my website and moved on to creating a general layout for the visual aspect of it. At some point I will need to learn more about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS so that my website functions as well as possible.

This week I did not spend any time working on my 20 time project again. The next steps for this project will be to choose a purpose for the website and plan out how it will look. These steps should be made in the next couple of weeks so that I can move on to starting the basics of the website. I would also like to learn more about the languages required to make my website at some point so that I can add to it.
