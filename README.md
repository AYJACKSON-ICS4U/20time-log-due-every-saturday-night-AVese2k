This week I have decided to make a website for the 20 time project. I am still in the process of figuring out what the website will be about, so I have not started coding anything yet. Before I start coding, I will have to learn the languages that are neccessary to make a website. This week, I plan on deciding the purpose of the website and continuing to learn the languages needed to make it.

This week I have continued to learn the languages that I will use to make my website. Specifically, I have finished learning the essentials of JavaScript and have moved on to the basics of HTML and CSS. In the next week, I will advance to more of the details of the two languages. I planned on deciding the purpose of my website this week, but I am still in the process of making that decision.

This week I started learning the details of HTML and CSS. I spent all my time in class progressing in these two languages, so I did not choose a topic for my website. Next week, I would like to finish the HTML/CSS lessons on Khan Academy and depending on how much time that leaves I could choose the purpose of my website.

In the past week, I continued learning the details of HTML and CSS, but did not finish the lessons on Khan Academy. By the end of this week I would like to finish these lessons and move on to something else. The process of choosing the purpose of my website is still ongoing.
